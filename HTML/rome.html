        <h1>The Roman Empire</h1>
<p>The <strong>Roman Empire</strong> was one of the most powerful civilizations in history, shaping politics, culture, architecture, and law across Europe and the Mediterranean. It began in <strong>27 BC</strong> when Augustus became the first emperor and lasted until <strong>476 AD</strong> in the Western Roman Empire, while the Eastern Roman Empire (later known as the Byzantine Empire) continued until <strong>1453 AD</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>Rome started as a small city-state on the Italian peninsula. It evolved from a monarchy to a republic in <strong>509 BC</strong>, where elected senators and magistrates governed. Rome gradually expanded through alliances, warfare, and conquest.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Government and Politics</h2>

<li><strong>Roman Empire (27 BC–476 AD)</strong>: Transitioned to imperial rule under Augustus, centralizing power while maintaining some republican traditions.  </li>
<li><strong>Law</strong>: Roman law became the foundation of legal systems in many modern countries. The <strong>Twelve Tables</strong> were one of the earliest codifications of law.</li>
